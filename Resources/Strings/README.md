These files are generated by the XLIFF Extractor target, after exporting .xcloc localization catalogs to this folder from the Recon Bolt Localizations folder (which is why it's named that way—that's the default name Xcode uses when hitting "Export Localizations…", so you just press enter and overwrite).

This seems like the only way to turn the strings Xcode automatically extracts from Swift code into .strings files suitable for uploading to Crowdin. .xliff would work there, but moving a file in the project loses the identity of the file on there, and the organization kinda sucks—it's all seen as one file, and the paths of the original files are just put in the context strings.
