Recon Bolt started development in early 2021, back when it wasn't yet possible to see your RR gains and losses in the game, but the API offered those numbers. I made an app to see the numbers and better understand my rank changes.

As you can guess, the scope expanded massively over time to what you're using now. I hope you're enjoying it!

Recon Bolt於2021年當初開始開發，當時還無法在遊戲中看到您的RR上升和下跌，但API提供了這些數字。 我製作了一個應用程式來檢視數字並更好地瞭解我的排名變化。

正如您可以猜測的那樣，隨著時間的推移，範圍會大大擴充套件到您現在使用的內容。 我希望你喜歡它！

如果您遇到錯誤或有一些反饋，我總是很高興在Discord伺服器或GitHub上聽到它:)";

I believe it will remain installed if you currently have it, but I'm not sure if I'll still be able to verify Pro purchases.

If you or someone you know works at Riot, get in touch with me—there's a few ways linked in the About Recon Bolt section below.

I would still be grateful for your support if you do purchase it! But it's at your own risk because I cannot guarantee that you'll enjoy the promised features going forward :(" = "不幸的是，Riot 現在正在使用他們的知識產權來關閉這個應用程序。 我正在嘗試與他們討論以找到前進的方向，但我目前無法保證該應用程序將保持可用狀態。 我相信如果您目前擁有它，它會保持安裝狀態，但我不確定我是否仍然能夠驗證 Pro 購買。

如果您或您認識的人在 Riot 工作，請與我聯繫——下面的關於 Recon Bolt 部分提供了幾種鏈接方式。

如果您購買它，我仍然會感謝您的支持！ 但這需要您自擔風險，因為我不能保證您會享受未來承諾的功能:(
